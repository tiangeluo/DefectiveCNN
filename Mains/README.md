- main_xxx_drop_ttt_pp.py: codes for training models on CIFAR-10 dataset, where xxx means the network archtecture or used methods, ttt means the position to apply defective convolutional layers, and pp means the (1 - keep probability). If xxx is omitted, the code train a model based on ResNet-18.

- main.py: code for training the standard CNN.

- utils.py: code for supporting the training.
